// Every backup destination (Google Drive, WebDAV, FTP, ...) implements this same
// shape. The rest of the backups module (encryption, packaging, scheduling,
// history, restore) is written once against this interface and never needs to
// know which destination it's talking to.
//
// `credentials` is a plain object of driver-specific secrets (e.g. `{ refreshToken }`
// for Google Drive, `{ username, password }` for WebDAV/FTP). It is only ever
// decrypted in memory for the duration of a single operation — see
// backups.encryption.service.ts for how it's stored at rest.
//
// `settings` is driver-specific *non-secret* config (base URL, port, remote path
// prefix, etc.) stored as-is (not encrypted) on the destination row, so the
// settings page can display it without needing to decrypt anything.
